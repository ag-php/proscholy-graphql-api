| Register The Auto Loader

|

| into the script here so that we don't have to worry about manual
| loading any of our classes later on. It feels great to relax.
|
| Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come.
| Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day
| our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses,  as we forgive those
| who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation,
| but deliver us from evil.
|
| Amen
